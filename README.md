# vae_models
Collection of python scripts running VAE models using Keras and Tensorflow as backend

This repository is a collection of VAE-scripts for image classification and generation and text classification and generation
(upcoming)

1. fashion_autoencoder.py has a python script that builds a VAE model using Keras for Fashion-MNIST dataset. Following are some
images that were generated by the network.
